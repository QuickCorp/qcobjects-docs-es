# Cross Browser Javascript Framework for MVC Patterns
----------------------------------------

[QCObjects](https://qcobjects.dev) is a javascript framework designed to make easier everything about the MVC patterns implementation into the pure javascript scope. You don't need to use typescript nor any transpiler to run [QCObjects](https://qcobjects.dev). It runs directly on the browser and it uses pure javascript with no extra dependencies of code. You can make your own components expressed in real native javascript objects or extend a native DOM object to use in your own way. You can also use [QCObjects](https://qcobjects.dev) in conjunction with CSS3 frameworks like [Foundation] (https://foundation.zurb.com), [Bootstrap] (https://getbootstrap.com) and mobile javascript frameworks like [PhoneGap] (https://phonegap.com) and OnsenUI (https://onsen.io)
