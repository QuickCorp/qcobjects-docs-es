# Micro-services Principals

The main goal of a microservice is that you can compact a fragment of backend functionality in a piece of code that can be called remotely from another backend or frontend terminal. Basically you can split a high level backend service into a multiple small micro-services that can complete the task. There are thousands of good examples of this kind of pattern adoption. You can read more about this concept in the following external links (only for reference and study):

With QCObjects you can code your microservices in a way more fancy, clean and quick.
