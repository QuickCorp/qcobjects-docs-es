# Start serving your files with QCObjects

To start using the QCObjects HTTP2 Built-In Server, you just go to your project path and execute the following command line in your bash shell:

```shell
> qcobjects launch mynewapp
```

or

```shell
> qcobjects-server
```

It will start serving the files inside the folder you are present, unsing a built-in HTTP2 Server with the default configuration settings.
