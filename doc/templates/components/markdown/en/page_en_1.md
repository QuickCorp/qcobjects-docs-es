# QCObjects

Welcome to [QCObjects](https://qcobjects.dev). An Open-source framework that empowers full-stack developers to make micro-services and micro-frontends into an N-Tier architecture.

With QCObjects devlopers are also able to code front-end and back-end together using a common syntax in pure JavaScript. It is cross-browser, cross-platform and cross-frame.

Install it, make a textfield or a navigate home functionality, all in just one step.
