# Principals

Here are the principals with QCObjects was made with:

0. You should type in JavaScript to code a JavaScript application.
1. Everything is an object.
2. Every object has a definition.
3. On the front-end side, any object can be stacked into the DOM or Virtual-DOM without the need to re-declare its definition.
4. Every object has a body.
5. A class should be the main definition of an object.
6. A class should be easy typed as an object itself.
7. Your code should be easily organised into packages.
8. Your code should be possible to easily scafold your applications into a clean architecture.
9. A component is an entity that has an object representation, and a tag declaration. The content of a component should be possible to be filled up remotely and locally. As a component is an object, it has a body as well, and the body of the component normally is an stacked instance of a DOM element.
10. A component can be attached to the DOM or detached from it without affecting its functionality.
11. A service call can be extended to scafold its functionality.
12. You should be able to import a package remotely.
13. You should be able to scafold your code and also controlling your savings on the server side by not doing unnecessary calls to remote sources. You should not need to repeat yourself coding this kind of controls.
14. You should be able to code your N-Tier application in a single language or syntax.
15. You should be able to apply any template you want to a component, it doesn't matter the what syntax or language the template was written with.
16. If an HTML tag is already represented by a DOM object instance, you should not need to duplicate this instance definition in order to render its contents.
17. Your HTML main page should be clean. But you should be able to bind what controls the tag behaviour without affecting the HTML syntax.
18. The order of execution of your code should be easily understandable and readable from the code, and the rendering process of every component should have and execution control in as many layers you need.
19. A layered pattern (like MVC or MVCC) should be present for every component. It doesn't matter if you define every layer or not.
20. The behaviour of a component should not be determined by its rendering process.
21. It is necessary a components stack that splits the DOM into a subjacent tree of attached elements. So now it exists and it is called The QCObjects Nested Components Stack.
22. You should be able to extend a component instance. But you should be able to control its dynamic behaviour without affecting its initial declaration.
23. You should be able to apply simultaneous visual effects and animations in an easy way to any DOM element instance.
24. You should be able to control the visual effects and animations either from CSS or JavaScript without affecting the performance.
25. You should be able to control the behaviour of your code Into-the-box and out-of-the-box and survive doing it.
