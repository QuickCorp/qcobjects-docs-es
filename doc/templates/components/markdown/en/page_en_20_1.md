# Essentials
Here are the essentials symbols and concepts of [QCObjects](https://qcobjects.dev) Reference

### QCObjects

Basic Type of all elements

### ComplexStorageCache

With **ComplexStorageCache** you can handle a cache for any object and save it in the local storage.

#### Usage:
```javascript
var cache = new ComplexStorageCache({
                      index:object.id, // Object Index
                      load:(cacheController)=>{}, // A function to execute for the first time
                      alternate: (cacheController)=>{} // The alternate function to execute from the second time the source coude is loaded
                      });
```

#### Example:
```javascript
var dataObject = {id:1,
                  prop1:1,
                  prop2:2
                };

var cache = new ComplexStorageCache({
    index: dataObject.id,
    load: (cacheController) => {
      dataObject = {
              id:dataObject.id,
              prop1:dataObject.prop1*2, // changing a property value
              prop2:dataObject.prop2
            };
      return dataObject;
    },
    alternate: (cacheController) => {
      dataObject = cacheController.cache.getCached(dataObject.id); // setting dataObject with the cached value
      return;
    }
  });

// Next time you can get the object from the cache
var dataObjectCopyFromCache = cache.getCached(dataObject.id);
console.log(dataObjectCopyFromCache); // will show the very same object value than dataObject
```

### asyncLoad

The **asyncLoad** function loads a code once in async mode. This is useful to asure some initial process don't replicate its execution and aren't loaded after sensitive code.

#### Usage:
```javascript
asyncLoad(()=>{
  // my code here
},args);
// Where args is an array of arguments, it can be the "arguments" special object
```

#### Example:
```javascript

let doSomething = (arg1,arg2)=>{
  asyncLoad((arg1,arg2)=>{
    console.log(arg1);
    console.log(arg2);
  },arguments);
};

doSomething(1,2); // the code of doSomething will be executed once after the rest of asyncLoad queue of functions and before the execution of Ready event.

```


### Class

This is NOT the class definition of ECMAScript 2015 (see [class ECMAScript 2015](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes) for reference).

Class is a special function to help you to declare a class in an easier and compatible way. It works cross-browser, and I hope ECMA could adopt something like that in the future. To let javascript not to be confuse about this, [QCObjects](https://qcobjects.dev) uses "Class" not "class" (note the Camel Case).

#### Usage:

```javascript
Class('MyClassName',MyClassDefinition);
```
Where **MyClassDefinition** is an object with a QCObjects  **prototype**

#### Example:
```javascript
Class('MyClassName',InheritClass,{
  propertyName1:0, // just to declare purpose
  propertyName2:'',
  classMethod1: function (){
    // some code here
    // note you can use "this" object
    return this.propertyName1;
  },
  classMethod2: function () {
    // some code here
    return this.propertyName2;
  }
});

var newObject = New(MyClassName,{
    propertyName1:1, // this initializes the value in 1
    propertyName2:"some value"
});
console.log(newObject.classMethod1()); // this will show number 1
console.log(newObject.classMethod2()); // this will show "some value"

```


### QC_Append, append method

This is a special method inserted to make your life easier when you want to dynamically manipulate the **DOM**. You can insert even a **Component**, a **QCObjects** Object or a **DOM** Element inside another **HTMLElement**.

##### Usage:
```javascript
[element].append([object or element]);
```
#### Example:
```javascript
// This will create a QCObjects class named "canvas" extending a HTMLCanvasElement with a customAttr property that has a "custom" value
Class('canvas',HTMLCanvasElement,{
  customAttr:'custom'
});

// This will declare an instance canvas1 from the class canvas
let canvas1 = New(canvas,{
            width:100,
            height:100,
          });

// This will append the canvas1 object to the document body
document.body.append(canvas1);

```



### The \_super\_ method

When you extend a QCObjects class from another one, you can use \_super\_ method to get an instance from the main class definition.

#### Usage:
```javascript

_super_('MySuperClass','MySuperMethod').call(this,params)
// where this is the current instance and params are method parameters
```

#### Example:
```javascript
Class('MySuperiorClass',InheritClass,{
  propertyName1:0, // just to declare purpose
  propertyName2:'',
  classMethod1: function (){
    // some code here
    // note you can use "this" object
    return this.propertyName1;
  },
});

Class('MyClassName',MySuperiorClass,{
  propertyName1:0, // just to declare purpose
  propertyName2:'',
  classMethod2: function () {
    // The next line will execute classMethod1 from MySuperiorClass
    // but using the current instance of MyClassName1
    return _super_('MySuperiorClass','classMethod1').call(this);
  }
});

var newObject = New(MyClassName,{
    propertyName1:1, // this initializes the value in 1
    propertyName2:"some value"
});
console.log(newObject.classMethod2()); // this will show the number 1
```

### New

Creates an object instance of a QCObjects class definition.

#### Usage:

```javascript
let objectInstance = New(QCObjectsClassName, properties);
// where properties is a single object with the property values
```
NOTE: In the properties object you can use single values or getter as well but they will be executed once.

#### Example:

```javascript
Class('MyCustomClass',Object);
let objectInstance = New(MyCustomClass,{
  prop1:1,
  get randomNumber(){ // this getter will be executed once
    return Math.random();
  }
});

console.log(objectInstance.randomNumber); // it will show console.log(objectInstance.prop1); // it will show number 1
```


### InheritClass
A single common used QCObjects class definition.

### ClassFactory
Use **ClassFactory** to get the Class declaration factory instance of a QCObjects Class
You can get either a Class factory from a Package or from the Class queue stack

To retreive the ClassFactory from the Class queue stack you can simply use the name of a Class as calling directly in the code.

#### Example:

```javascript
/* When you declare MyClass using Class() it is instantly added to the Class queue stack
* and you can get the factory either using ClassFactory() or calling the name MyClass straight in the code
*/
Class('MyClass',{
	a:1
})
console.log(MyClass == ClassFactory('MyClass')) // it will show true
```

```javascript
/* On the other hand, ClassFactory() will be so useful when you define a Class into a Package
*/
Package('org.quickcorp.package1',[
	Class('MyClass',{
		a:1
	})
])
console.log(MyClass == ClassFactory('MyClass')) // it will still show true
// The following line will show true as well
console.log(MyClass == ClassFactory('org.quickcorp.package1.MyClass'))
```

```javascript
/* The interesting thing is when you have declared more than one Class using the
* same name MyClass into different packages but with different property default values
* and even properties
*/
Package('org.quickcorp.package1',[
	Class('MyClass',{
		a:1
	})
])
Package('org.quickcorp.package2',[
	Class('MyClass',{
		a:2,
		b:1
	})
])
// The last declaration of MyClass will be the one survival in the Class queue
// so the reference MyClass in the code will point to that one
console.log(MyClass == ClassFactory('MyClass')) // it will still show true

// In this case as the MyClass defined in the org.quickcorp.package1 will not be the same
// as the one in the org.quickcorp.package2, but the MyClass in the package2 is the last one
// The following line will show false
console.log(MyClass == ClassFactory('org.quickcorp.package1.MyClass'))

// The following line will show true
console.log(MyClass == ClassFactory('org.quickcorp.package2.MyClass'))

// The following line will show false
console.log(ClassFactory('org.quickcorp.package1.MyClass') == ClassFactory('org.quickcorp.package2.MyClass'))
```

The above examples are intentionally done to explain and show how the scope of the Class definitions in QCObjects is protected and handled and it is reflected in the use of ClassFactory.

So you are gonna want to use ClassFactory when you need complete control over the scope when extending Classes

**Example**

```javascript
// When normally you extend a Class using the Class queue you do:
Class('MyExtendedClass',MyInheritClass,{
	extendedProp1: 'value of prop',
	extendedProp2: 2
})

```

```javascript
/* But to protect the scope from misleading by reference, you can asure that MyInheritClass
is the one you want to extend by declaring it into a package and then extend it
*/
Package('org.quickcorp.mypackage1',[
	Class('MyInheritClass',{
		sourceProp:1
	}),
])

// The following code is a definition of MyExtendedClass into a different package
// org.quickcorp.package2
// extending MyInheritClass using ClassFactory to retreive the Class from the source package
// org.quickcorp.mypackage1
Package('org.quickcorp.mypackage2',[
	Class('MyExtendedClass',ClassFactory('org.quickcorp.mypackage1.MyInheritClass'),{
		extendedProp1: 'value of prop',
		extendedProp2: 2
	})
])

// this will show the number 1 (as the inherited default value of sourceProp)
console.log(New(MyExtendedClass).sourceProp)

```

### \_Crypt
With \_Crypt you can encode serializable objects by a passphrase

#### Example (1):

```javascript
 var _string = New(_Crypt,{string:'hello world',key:'some encryption md5 key'});
 console.log(_string._encrypt());
 console.log(_string._decrypt()); // decodes encrypted string to the source
```
 #### Example (2):

```javascript
 _Crypt.encrypt('hola mundo','12345678866');
 _Crypt.decrypt('nqCelFSiq6Wcpw==','12345678866');
```


### GLOBAL

**GLOBAL** is a special QCObjects class to reach the global scope. It has a set and a get method to help you to manage the internal GLOBAL properties.

#### Example:

```javascript
GLOBAL.set('globalProperty1','some value in global scope');
var globalProperty1 = GLOBAL.get('globalProperty1');
```

### CONFIG

CONFIG is a smart class that manages the global settings of your application. You can get the properties either from a config.json or from the memory previously saved by a set() call.

#### Usage from memory:

1.- In your initial code set the CONFIG initial values:
```javascript
CONFIG.set('someSettingProperty','some initial value');
```
2.- Then you can access it from anywhere in your code by using the get method:
```javascript
var someSettingProperty = CONFIG.get('someSettingProperty');
```

#### Usage from config.json:

1.- You need to indicate first that you are using a config.json file by setting the "useConfigService" value to true
```javascript
CONFIG.set('useConfigService',true); // using config.json for custom settings config
```
2.- Once you have set the value above QCObjects will know and look to the next CONFIG settings into the file config.json in the basePath folder of your application.

#### Usage from an encrypted config.json:

There is also a way to use an encrypted config.json file in order to protect your settings robots that can steal unprotected data from your web application (like API keys web crawlers).

To encrypt your json file go to https://config.qcobjects.dev, put your domain and the config.json content. The tool will encrypt your json and you can copy the encrypted content to insert it in your config.json file. QCObjects will know the data is encrypted and the process to decode the data will be transparent for you.

#### Dynamic CONFIG Settings

Sometimes you will need to set a value from a source that isn't static, like the ENV vars or another custom source of dynamic data. To get a value using CONFIG from a dynamic source you have to use a processor. There are common processors predefined like $ENV (only available on CLI, Collab and Node) and $config (available on all environments).

Processors are called as a meta value either into the config.json file or in the CONFIG Class.

```json
// file: config.json
{
	"domain":"localhost",
	"env1":"$ENV(ENV1)",
	"customSettings":{
		"value1":"$config(domain)"
	}
}
```

```javascript
let value1 = CONFIG.get("customSettings").value1;
// value1 = "localhost";

let env1 = CONFIG.get("env1");
//env1 = (environment variable ENV1)
```

```javascript
// sets the key "api_key" of the CONFIG settings to a dynamic processor $ENV that recovers the value of API_KEY from the environment variables
CONFIG.set("api_key","$ENV(API_KEY)");

let api_key = CONFIG.get("api_key");
// api_key will contain the value of the system API_KEY environment var
// ($ENV processor returns a valid value only on Node.js , QCObjects CLI and QCObjects Collab engine)
```

### Processor

Static Class that used to set custom processors for CONFIG.

#### Usage:

```javascript
Processor.setProcessor(processor)
```

Where **processor** is a named function that receives the arguments of the processor

#### Example:

You have an environment variable called **SERVICE_URL** that stores a url of a service. You have to use that value in your config settings in the **serviceURL** value but you also need to set the **host** and the **port** settings using the parsed value of that url. To parse the value of SERVICE_URL environment variable on-demand and fill up the corresponding settings in your config.json, Your config.json file will look like this:

```json
// file: config.json
{
	"serviceURL":"$ENV(SERVICE_URL)",
	"host":"$SERVICE_HOST(SERVICE_URL)",
	"port":"$SERVICE_PORT(SERVICE_URL)"
}
```

The **$SERVICE_HOST** and **$SERVICE_PORT** processors don't exist. To define them, you must use:

```javascript
// execute the next code in your init.js file or before to load the CONFIG settings

let SERVICE_HOST = function (arg){
	var processorHandler = this; // to make this always works, do not use arrow functions to define your
	let serviceURL = new URL(processorHandler.processors.ENV(arg));
	return serviceURL.host;
}
let SERVICE_PORT = function (arg){
	var processorHandler = this; // to make this always works, do not use arrow functions to define your
	let serviceURL = new URL(processorHandler.processors.ENV(arg));
	return serviceURL.port;
}

Processor.setProcessor(SERVICE_HOST);
Processor.setProcessor(SERVICE_PORT);
```

Then you only need to set your environment variable SERVICE_URL in your shell

This is only for Unix/Linux systems

```shell
export SERVICE_URL="https://example.com:443/path-to-a-resource/"
```

and your settings will be dynamically loaded like this:

```json
{
	"serviceURL":"https://example.com:443/path-to-a-resource/",
	"host":"example.com",
	"port":"443"
}
```

And you get the corresponding values using **CONFIG.get(value)**

### waitUntil
waitUntil is a helper just in case you are in trouble trying to run a code before a condition is true. The code inside waitUntil will be executed once.

NOTE: This is useful in some cases but an excessive use is not recommended.

#### Usage:
```javascript
waitUntil(()=>{
  // the code that will be executed after the condition is true
},()=>{return condition;});
// where condition is what I want to wait for
```

#### Example:
```javascript
let someVar = 0;
waitUntil(()=>{
  console.log('someVar is present');
},()=>{return typeof someVar != 'undefined';});
// where condition is what I want to wait for
```


### Package
Defines a QCObjects package and returns it.

#### Usage:
```javascript
Package('packageName',[packageContent]);
```
Where packageContent is an array of QCObjects Classes. If you only pass the packageName param you will get the previously declared package content.

#### Example (1):
```javascript
'use strict';
Package('org.quickcorp.main',[
  Class('Main',InheritClass,{
    propertyName1:'propertyValue1',
  }),
  Class('MyCustomClass',InheritClass,{
    propertyName2:'propertyValue2',
  }),
]);
```
#### Example (2):
```javascript
let mainPackage = Package('org.quickcorp.main'); // this will return the previously declared content of package 'org.quickcorp.main'
// mainPackage[0] will be the Main class definition.
// This is useful for code introspection
```

The packages loading technique present in QCObjects is promise based and also scope oriented. You can ask if a package is loaded simply calling the Package() function passing a package name as an argument.


### Import
Imports a package from another JS file

#### Usage:
```javascript
Import (packagename,[ready],[external]);
```
Where packagename is the name of the package, ready is a function that will be executed after the package is loaded, and external is a boolean value that indicates if the JS file is in the same origin or it is from another external resource.

#### Example (1):
```javascript
Import('org.quickcorp.main');
```
The above code will try to import a JS fila named 'org.quickcorp.main.js' from the path specified in the **relativeImportPath** settings value present in your **CONFIG**. Inside the JS file you have to define a package by using Package('org.quickcorp.main',[Class1, Class2...])

#### Example (2):
```javascript
Import('org.quickcorp.main',function (){
  console.log('remote import is loaded');
},true);
```
The above code this time is trying to load the same package but using an external path defined by the **remoteImportsPath** setting present in your **CONFIG**

NOTE: In both examples above you have not use or specify the ".js" extension. This it's used by default and can't be changed by security reasons.

### Export
Put a symbol (var or function) in the global scope.

#### Usage:

```javascript
Export('name of symbol');
```

#### Example:
```javascript
(()=>{
  // this is local scope
  let someFunction = (someLocalParam)=>{
    console.log(someLocalParam);
  };
  Export(someFunction); // now, someFunction is in the top level scope.
})();


// this is the top level scope
someFunction('this works');
```

### Cast

Use the Cast method of any DOM element to get the properties of another type of object. This is useful to transform an object type to another giving more flexibility in your code.

#### Usage:

```javascript
let resultObject = [element or QCObjects type].Cast(objectToCastFrom);
```

Where objectToCastFrom is an object to get the properties from and put it into the result object returned by Cast.

#### Example:

```javascript
Class('MyOwnClass',{
  prop1:'1',
  prop2:2
});

let obj = document.createElement('div').Cast(MyOwnClass);
```

The above code will create a DOM object and Cast it to MyOwnClass. Because of MyOwnClass is a QCObjects type class, obj will now have a prop1 and prop2 properties, and will now be a QCObjects object instance with a body property that is a div element.

### Tag

Tag is a useful function to select any DOM element using selectors. Tag will always return a list of elements, that you can map, sort, and filter as any other list.

#### Usage:

```javascript
var listOfElements = Tag(selector);
```

Where selector is a DOM query selector.

#### Example:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
    	<title>Demo</title>
    	<script type="text/javascript" src="https://qcobjects.dev/QCObjects.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
    <div class="myselector">
    <p>Hello world</p>
    </div>
    <script>
    Ready(()=>{
      Tag('.myselector > p').map((element)=>{
        element.innerHTML = 'Hello world! How are you?';
      });
    });
    </script>
    </body>
</html>
```

In the above code, a paragraph element was created inside a div with a css class named myselector by html, and then is  modified dynamically using the QCObjects Tag function. If you are familiar with query selector frameworks like JQuery, you will love this one.

### Ready
Assign a function to run after everything is done by QCObjects and after the window.onload event. Use it to prevent 'undefined' DOM objects error.

#### Usage:
```javascript
Ready(()=>{
  // My init code here!
});
```
Note that if you define dynamic components by using a HTML "component" tag, the dynamic content load will not trigger Ready events. To catch code everytime a dynamic component is loaded, use a Controller done method instead.

You will use Ready implementation mostly when you want to implement QCObjects in conjunction with another framework that needs it.

### Component Class
A QCObjects class type for components.

#### Properties

**[Component].domain**
Returns a string with the domain of your application. It is automatically set by QCObjects at the load time.

**[Component].basePath**
Returns a string with the base path url of your application. It is automatically set by QCObjects at the load time.

NOTE: If you want to change the components base path, you have to use _CONFIG.set('componentsBasePath','new path relative to the domain')_ in your init code.

**[Component].templateURI**
Is a string representing the component template URI relative to the domain. When is set, the component will load a template and append the inner content into the body childs as a part of the DOM. To set this property, it is recommended to use the ComponentURI helper function.

**[Component].tplsource**
Is a string representing the source where the template will be loaded. It can be "default" or "none". A value of "default" will tell QCObjects to load the template from the templateURI content. A value of "none" will tell QCObjects not to load a template from anywhere.

**[Component].url**
Is a string representing the entire url of the component. It is automatically set by QCObjects when the component is instantiated.

**[Component].name**
Is a string representing the name of a component. The name of a component can be any alphanumeric value that identifies the component type. It will be internally used by ComponentURI to build a normalised component template URI.

**[Component].method**
Is a string representing a HTTP or HTTPS method. By default, every component is set to use the "GET" method. In the most of cases, you don't need to change this property.

**[Component].data**
Is an object representing the data of the component. When QCObjects loads a template, it will get every property of data object and bind it to a template label representing the same property inside the template content between double brakets (example: {{prop1}} in the template content will represent data.prop1 in the component instance).
NOTE: To refresh the data bindings it is needed to rebuild the component (see the use of [Component].rebuild() method for more details ).

**[Component].reload**
Is a boolean value that tells QCObjects when to force reload the content of a component from the template or not. If its value is true, the template content will be replacing the current DOM childs of the component body element. If its value is false, the template content will be added after the las component body child.

**[Component].cached**
Is a boolean value that tells QCObjects if the component needs to be cached or not. When a component is cached, the template content loaded from templateURI will be loaded once. You can set this property either as a static property of the Component Class to set the default value for every next component object instance, or setting the individual value of the property in every component definition. In a world where the performance matters, to give more flexibility to the cache behaviour is needed more than ever.

**[Component].routingWay**
Returns a string representing the routing way. Its value can be "hash", "pathname" or "search".
NOTE: To change the routingWay of every component it is recommended to use CONFIG.set('routingWay','value of a valid routing way') in your init code.

**[Component].validRoutingWays**
Returns a list representing the valid routing ways.  QCObjects uses this to internally validate the routingWay which was used to build the component routings.

**[Component].routingNodes**
Returns a NodeList object representing the list of nodes that were loaded by the component routing builder.

**[Component].routings**
Returns a list with the component routings built when the component was instantiated.

**[Component].routingPath**
Returns a string representing the current routing path

**[Component].routingSelected**
Returns an object representing the current routing of the component

**[Component].subcomponents**
Returns a list of components that are childs of the component instance.

**[Component].body**
Is a DOM element representing the body of the component.
NOTE: Every time a component body is set, it will trigger the routings builder for this component.

#### Methods
**[Component].set('prop',value)**
Sets a value for a component property.

**[Component].get('prop')**
Returns the value of a component property

**[Component].rebuild()**
Rebuilds the component. It will force a call for the componentLoader with this component when it's needed.

**[Component].Cast(ClassName or ComponentClassName)**
Returns the cast of a component definition into another one. This is useful to dynamically merge components definitions.

**[Component].route()**
Forces the component routings builder to reload the routings of the component. This will result in a rebuild call when it's needed.

**[Component].fullscreen()**
Puts the component in fullscreen mode.

**[Component].closefullscreen()**
Closes the fullscreen mode.

**[Component].css(css object)**
Sets the css properties for the component.

**[Component].append(component or QCObjects object)**
Appends a component as a child of the current component body

**[Component].attachIn(selector)**
Attaches a current component body to any element in the given selector.

### Component HTML Tag
Is a HTML tag representation of a component instance. Every declaration of a `<component></component>` tag will generate a related instance of a QCObjects component. While a component tag is not an instance itself, you can even define some instance properties by setting the related tag attribute when it is available.

#### Available attributes
Below is a list of the available attributes for a component tag

##### The name Attribute
**`<component name>`**
Sets the name of the related component instance built by QCObjects.

###### Usage:
```html
<component name="name_of_component"></component>
```

###### Example:
```html
<!-- index.html -->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
    	<title>Demo</title>
    	<script type="text/javascript" src="https://qcobjects.dev/QCObjects.js"></script>
    </head>
    <body>
      <!-- this will load the contents of ./templates/main[.tplextension] file -->
      <component name="main"></component>
    </body>
</html>
```

##### The cached Attribute
**`<component cached>`**
Sets the cached property if the related instance of a component.

NOTE: Only a value of "true" can be set in order to tell QCObjects that the component template content has to be cached. Any other value will be interpreted as false.

###### Usage:
```html
<component name="name_of_component" cached="true"></component>
```

##### The data property tag declaration
 **`<component data-property1 data-property2 ...>`**
Sets a static value of a property for the data object in the component instance.

NOTE: Data property tag declaration was thought with the purpose to give some simple way to mocking a dynamic component with template assignments. Don't use it thinking it is a bidirectional way data binding. While you can get a bidirectional way behaviour accesing a data object from a component instance, it is not the same for the component tag. Data property declaration in component tags is only one way data binding because of components tree architecture.

##### The controllerClass Attribute
**`<component controllerClass>`**
Defines a custom Controller Class for the component instance

###### Usage:
```html
<component name="name_of_component" controllerClass="ControllerClassName"></component>
```


##### The viewClass Attribute
 **`<component viewClass>`**
Defines a custom View Class for the component instance

###### Usage:
```html
<component name="name_of_component" viewClass="ViewClassName"></component>
```


##### The componentClass Attribute
**`<component componentClass>`**
Defines a custom Component Class for the component instance

###### Usage:
```html
<component name="name_of_component" componentClass="ComponentClassName"></component>
```

##### The effecClass Attribute
**`<component effectClass>`**
Defines a custom Effect Class for the component instance

###### Usage:
```html
<component name="name_of_component" effectClass="EffectClassName"></component>
```

##### The template-source Attribute
**`<component template-source>`**
Sets the tplsource property of the related instance of a component. Possible values are "none" or "default".

###### Usage:
```html
<component name="name_of_component" template-source="none"></component>
```

##### The tplextension Attribute
**`<component tplextension>`**
Sets the tplextension property of the related instance of a component. Possible values are any file extension. Default value is "html"

###### Usage:
```html
<component name="name_of_component" tplextension="tpl.html"></component>
```


#### ComponentURI
Is a helper function to let you define the templateURI for a component in a normalised way.

##### Example:
```javascript
var templateURI = ComponentURI({
  'COMPONENTS_BASE_PATH':CONFIG.get('componentsBasePath'),
  'COMPONENT_NAME':'main',
  'TPLEXTENSION':"tpl.html",
  'TPL_SOURCE':"default"
});

console.log(templateURI); // this will show something like "templates/components/main.tpl.html" depending on your CONFIG settings
```


#### componentLoader
Loads a component instance in a low level, and appends the component template content to the component body. In the most of cases you won't need to call componentLoader in order to load a component. This is automatically called by QCObjects when it's needed. componentLoader returns a promise that is resolved when the component load is done and rejected when the component load was failed.

##### Usage:
```javascript
 [Promise] componentLoader(componentInstance,load_async)
```

Where componentInstance is a component instance created by _`New(ComponentDefinitionClass)`_

##### Example:
```javascript
componentLoader(componentInstance,load_async).then(
  (successStandardResponse)=>{
    // component load successful
    var request = successStandardResponse.request;
    var component = successStandardResponse.component;
  },(failStandardResponse)=>{
    // component load failed
    var component = failStandardResponse.component;
  });
```


#### buildComponents
Rebuilds every component that is a child element of the DOM element who owns the method. In the most of cases, you won't need to call buildComponents in order to build or rebuild every component in the DOM. This is automatically called by QCObjects when it's needed.

##### Usage:
```javascript
[element].buildComponents()
```

##### Example:
```javascript
document.buildComponents()
```


### Controller
A built-in QCObjects Class to define a controller

### View
A built-in QCObjects View to define a view

### VO
A built-in QCObjects Class to define a value object


### Service
A QCObjects class type for services.


#### Properties

**[Service].domain**
Returns a string with the domain of your application. It is automatically set by QCObjects at the load time.

**[Service].basePath**
Returns a string with the base path url of your application. It is automatically set by QCObjects at the load time.

**[Service].url**
Is a string representing the entire url of the service. It can be absolute or relative to the basePath when it applies. It can be also an external url.

NOTE: To load a service of an external resource you need to specify the external parameter to true using serviceLoader.

**[Service].name**
Is a string representing the name of a component. The name of a service can be any alphanumeric value that identifies the service instance. It isn't a unique ID but only a descriptive name.

**[Service].method**
Is a string representing a HTTP or HTTPS method. Possible values are: "GET", "POST", "PUT", ... any other that is accepted by REST services calls.

**[Service].data**
Is an object representing the data of the service. When QCObjects loads a service. It receives the response and interpretes it as a  template. So once a service response is obtained, it will get every property of data object and bind it to a template label representing the same property inside the template content between double brakets (example: {{prop1}} in the template content will represent data.prop1 in the service instance).


**[Service].cached**
Is a boolean value that tells QCObjects if the service response needs to be cached or not. When a service is cached, the template content loaded from the service url will be loaded only once. You have to set this value to false for every Service instance you define in order to asure the service is loaded from the resource but not the storage cache.

#### Methods
**[Service].set('prop',value)**
Sets a value for a service property.

**[Service].get('prop')**
Returns the value of a service property


### serviceLoader
Loads a service instance and returns a promise that is resolved when the service has a successful response load and is rejected when it fails loading the response.

#### Usage:
```javascript
[Promise] serviceLoader(serviceInstance)
```

#### Example:
```javascript
Class('MyTestService',Service,{
    name:'myservice',
    external:true,
    cached:false,
    method:'GET',
    headers:{'Content-Type':'application/json'},
    url:'https://api.github.com/orgs/QuickCorp/repos',
    withCredentials:false,
    _new_:()=>{
      // service instantiated
    },
    done:()=>{
      // service loaded
    }
});
var service = serviceLoader(New(MyTestService,{
  data:{param1:1}
})).then(
  (successfulResponse)=>{
    // This will show the service response as a plain text
    console.log(successfulResponse.service.template);
  },
  (failedResponse)=>{

  });
```


### JSONService
Is a built-in definition for a JSON Service Class

#### Properties

**[JSONService].domain**
Returns a string with the domain of your application. It is automatically set by QCObjects at the load time.

**[JSONService].basePath**
Returns a string with the base path url of your application. It is automatically set by QCObjects at the load time.

**[JSONService].url**
Is a string representing the entire url of the service. It can be absolute or relative to the basePath when it applies. It can be also an external url.

NOTE: To load a service of an external resource you need to specify the external parameter to true using serviceLoader.

**[JSONService].name**
Is a string representing the name of a component. The name of a service can be any alphanumeric value that identifies the service instance. It isn't a unique ID but only a descriptive name.

**[JSONService].method**
Is a string representing a HTTP or HTTPS method. Possible values are: "GET", "POST", "PUT", ... any other that is accepted by REST services calls.

**[JSONService].data**
Is an object representing the data of the service. When QCObjects loads a service. It receives the response and interpretes it as a  template. So once a service response is obtained, it will get every property of data object and bind it to a template label representing the same property inside the template content between double brakets (example: {{prop1}} in the template content will represent data.prop1 in the service instance).


**[JSONService].cached**
Is a boolean value that tells QCObjects if the service response needs to be cached or not. When a service is cached, the template content loaded from the service url will be loaded only once. You have to set this value to false for every Service instance you define in order to asure the service is loaded from the resource but not the storage cache.

#### Methods
**[JSONService].set('prop',value)**
Sets a value for a service property.

**[JSONService].get('prop')**
Returns the value of a service property

#### Example:
```javascript
Class('MyTestJSONService',JSONService,{
    name:'myJSONservice',
    external:true,
    cached:false,
    method:'GET',
    withCredentials:false,
    url:'https://api.github.com/orgs/QuickCorp/repos',
    _new_:function (){
      // service instantiated
      delete this.headers.charset; // do not send the charset header
    },
    done:function (result){
      _super_('JSONService','done').call(this,result);
    }
});
var service = serviceLoader(New(MyTestJSONService,{
  data:{param1:1}
})).then(
  (successfulResponse)=>{
    // This will show the service response as a JSON object
    console.log(successfulResponse.service.JSONresponse);
  },
  (failedResponse)=>{

  });
```

### ConfigService
Is a built-in Class definition to load the CONFIG settings from a config.json file

#### Example:
```javascript
// To set the config.json file relative url
ConfigService.configFileName='config.json'; // it is done by default
CONFIG.set('useConfigService',true); // using config.json for custom settings config
```


### SourceJS

Use SourceJS as a static Class that is helping you to load external JS dependencies. This is commonly used to load libraries that are external and that not follow the QCObjects packages syntax.

#### Example:
```javascript
Class("MyNewController",Controller,{
	_new_:function (){
		var controller = this;
		controller.dependencies.push(
			New(SourceJS,{
				external:false,
				url:'doc/js/my-js-resource.js',
				done:function(){
					logger.debug("Dependency loaded")
				}})
			);
	}
})
```

### SourceCSS

A static Class that is used to load an external CSS resource.

```javascript
Class("MyNewController",Controller,{
	dependencies:[],
	done (){
		this.dependencies.push(New(SourceCSS,{
			external:false,
			url:CONFIG.get('basePath')+'css/my-css-resource.css'
		}));
	}
});
```

### Effect

**Effect** is a super class to define custom effects.

#### Example:

```javascript
Class('CustomFade',Effect,{
	duration:500, // milliseconds of duration
	apply: function (){
		// You need the following line to apply a Fade effect in runtime
		_super_('Fade','apply').apply(this,arguments);
	}
})
```


### Timer

**Timer** is a special implementation of **requestAnimationFrame** to emulate the creation of thread instances, so you can handle runtime paralell processing in a little bit more efficient way.

NOTE: As it is currently depending in requestAnimationFrame availability it only works on modern browsers.

#### Example:

```javascript
Timer.thread({
		duration:300, // duration in milliseconds
		timing(timeFraction,elapsed){
			return timeFraction; // you can change this line to return a custom math function for timing
		},
		intervalInterceptor(progress){
			if (progress>=100){
				// do whatever you want here
			}
		}
});
```
