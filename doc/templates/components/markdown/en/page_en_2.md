# The meaning of the name QCObjects (Do not forget the Q)

Often, some people is confusing **QCObjects** name with **CObjects** (perhaps some day it changes, who knows...) but the Q has an important meaning: It means Quick! What the complete name QCObjects does mean is **Quick Components and Objects**, and that is why the Q, C, O letters are capitalized.
