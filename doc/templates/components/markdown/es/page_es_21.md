# Start Coding
## Step 1: Start creating a main import file and name it like: cl.quickcorp.js. Put it into packages/js/ file directory

```javascript
"use strict";
/*
* QuickCorp/QCObjects is licensed under the
* GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0
* [LICENSE] (https://github.com/QuickCorp/QCObjects/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)
*
* Permissions of this copyleft license are conditioned on making available
* complete source code of licensed works and modifications under the same
* license or the GNU GPLv3. Copyright and license notices must be preserved.
* Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights. However, a larger
* work using the licensed work through interfaces provided by the licensed
* work may be distributed under different terms and without source code for
* the larger work.
*
* Copyright (C) 2015 Jean Machuca,<correojean@gmail.com>
*
* Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
* license document, but changing it is not allowed.
*/


Import ('external/libs');
Import ('cl.quickcorp.model');
Import ('cl.quickcorp.components');
Import ('cl.quickcorp.controller');
Import ('cl.quickcorp.view');

Package('cl.quickcorp',[
  Class('FormValidator',Object,{

  }),
]);

```

## Step 2: Then create some services inhereting classes into the file js/packages/cl.quickcorp.services.js :

```javascript
"use strict";
/*
* QuickCorp/QCObjects is licensed under the
* GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0
* [LICENSE] (https://github.com/QuickCorp/QCObjects/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)
*
* Permissions of this copyleft license are conditioned on making available
* complete source code of licensed works and modifications under the same
* license or the GNU GPLv3. Copyright and license notices must be preserved.
* Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights. However, a larger
* work using the licensed work through interfaces provided by the licensed
* work may be distributed under different terms and without source code for
* the larger work.
*
* Copyright (C) 2015 Jean Machuca,<correojean@gmail.com>
*
* Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
* license document, but changing it is not allowed.
*/


Package('cl.quickcorp.service',[
	Class('FormSubmitService',JSONService,{
	    name:'mySubmitService',
	    external:true,
	    cached:false,
	    method:'POST',
	    withCredentials:false,
	    url:'https://api.github.com/orgs/QuickCorp/repos',
	    _new_:function (){
	      // service instantiated
	      delete this.headers.charset; // do not send the charset header
	    },
	    done:function (result){
	      _super_('JSONService','done').call(this,result);
	    },
			fail: function(result) {
	      //TODO negative case
	      console.log("***** ERROR");
	    }
  })
])
```

## Step 3: Now it's time to create the components (cl.quickcorp.components.js)

```javascript
"use strict";
/*
* QuickCorp/QCObjects is licensed under the
* GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0
* [LICENSE] (https://github.com/QuickCorp/QCObjects/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)
*
* Permissions of this copyleft license are conditioned on making available
* complete source code of licensed works and modifications under the same
* license or the GNU GPLv3. Copyright and license notices must be preserved.
* Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights. However, a larger
* work using the licensed work through interfaces provided by the licensed
* work may be distributed under different terms and without source code for
* the larger work.
*
* Copyright (C) 2015 Jean Machuca,<correojean@gmail.com>
*
* Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
* license document, but changing it is not allowed.
*/
Package('cl.quickcorp.components',[
	Class('MyCustomComponent',Component,{
	  name:'mycustomcomponent',
	  cached:false,
	  controller:null,
	  view:null,
		templateURI:ComponentURI({
			'COMPONENTS_BASE_PATH':Component.basePath,
			'COMPONENT_NAME':'mycustomcomponent',
			'TPLEXTENSION':'tpl.html',
			'TPL_SOURCE':'default'
		})
	})
]);
```

## Step 4: Once you have done the above components declaration, you will now want to code your controllers (cl.quickcorp.controller.js)


```javascript
"use strict";
/*
* QuickCorp/QCObjects is licensed under the
* GNU Lesser General Public License v3.0
* [LICENSE] (https://github.com/QuickCorp/QCObjects/blob/master/LICENSE.txt)
*
* Permissions of this copyleft license are conditioned on making available
* complete source code of licensed works and modifications under the same
* license or the GNU GPLv3. Copyright and license notices must be preserved.
* Contributors provide an express grant of patent rights. However, a larger
* work using the licensed work through interfaces provided by the licensed
* work may be distributed under different terms and without source code for
* the larger work.
*
* Copyright (C) 2015 Jean Machuca,<correojean@gmail.com>
*
* Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
* license document, but changing it is not allowed.
*/
"use strict";
Package('cl.quickcorp.controller',[
	Class('MainController',Controller,{
		_new_:function (){
			//TODO: Implement
			logger.debug('MainController Element Initialized');
		}
	}),
	Class('MyAccountController',Controller,{
		component: null,
		done:function (){
			var controller = this;
			logger.debug('MyAccountController Element Initialized');
			this.component.body.setAttribute('loaded',true);
		},
		_new_:function (o){
			//TODO: Implement
			this.component = o.component;
		}
	}),
]);
```

## Step 5: To use into the HTML5 code you only need to do some settings between script tags

```html
<script>
CONFIG.set('relativeImportPath','js/packages/');
CONFIG.set('componentsBasePath','templates/components/');
CONFIG.set('delayForReady',1); // delay to wait before executing the first ready event, it includes imports
CONFIG.set('preserveComponentBodyTag',false); // don't use ```<componentBody></componentBody>``` tag

Import('cl.quickcorp'); // this will import your main file: cl.quickcorp.js into js/packages/ file path
</script>
```
